  <p><b>About GiveDirectly</b></p> 
  <p> GiveDirectly (GD) aims to reshape international giving – and millions of lives – by providing cash grants directly to the poorest people in the world. The Brookings Institution estimates that $100B of cash transfers would be required to eliminate the poverty gap; the aid sector currently spends $135B each year, much of it on evidence-free interventions. GiveDirectly wants to change that, establishing cash transfers as a benchmark for foreign aid – as the index fund is a benchmark for the financial industry – and in the process accelerating the end of extreme poverty.</p> 
  <p> GD has raised over $800M since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1 million people, and launched offices in 11 countries. We've also supported 19 large-scale, experimental research projects that indicate strong recipient impact of our programs – including the largest universal basic income experiment in history. We use concrete evidence to inform the design of our programs: from research results published in leading journals, to in-depth qualitative work. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company, while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD's leading role within it) have been featured in the New York Times Magazine, This American Life, Foreign Affairs, and The Economist.</p> 
  <p> We're looking for exceptional talent to grow our collaborative, diverse team. Joining GiveDirectly provides the opportunity to work alongside individuals who come from 21 different countries and speak 69 different languages. We're actively working toward an equitable and inclusive environment for all team members, and seek candidates who will bring diverse perspectives and experiences to our organization. We recruit from organizations across all industries: our team has hailed from sectors including start-ups, government, consultancies, investment banks, and nonprofits.</p> 
  <p> Across our global offices, our culture is candid, analytical, non-hierarchical, and fast-paced. We value ability, adaptability, and willingness to learn. We offer competitive salary and benefits, as well as performance-based bonuses.</p>

 <p><b> About the Field Data team</b></p> 
 <p> As we scale to reach millions of people experiencing extreme poverty, we believe that data can transform cash delivery by:</p>

  <li>Increasing operational efficiency</li> 
  <li>Mitigating risk</li> 
  <li>Conveying our impact to donors</li>

 <p>Ground breaking science. Advancing medicine. Healing made personal.</p> 
 <p><b>Job Title: </b><b>Data Scientist </b><b>- Mount Sinai Health Partners</b></p>
 <p><br> </p>
 <p><b>Background </b></p>
 <p>Mount Sinai is one of the largest U.S. health systems with a strong reputation for quality of care (17th ranked US academic medical center) and innovative research/education (17th ranked US medical school, &gt;$400M annually in NIH-funded research). This reputation is important but it’s not enough. At Mount Sinai, we have a responsibility to make healthcare better, optimizing its value for patients, purchasers, and communities. </p>
 <p>The health care industry has a number of problems. Chief among them is affordability as federal and state governments are unable to keep Medicare &amp; Medicaid solvent, employers are stretched to pay for health benefits for their employees, and those employees struggle to afford increasing paycheck deductions and deductibles. In addition, the industry has historically set a low bar for customer service, earning some of the lowest satisfaction scores of any industry, eroding trust from stakeholders. In recent years, employers and labor unions have begun to solve these problems by contracting directly with vendors and select providers to optimize value. </p>
 <p>Mount Sinai Solutions was created to collaborate directly with the purchaser to solve these problems. We have assembled Mount Sinai's clinical and population health assets into product offerings of high-quality care that are affordable and distinguish themselves via exceptional service. Our offerings include next-generation primary care at or near the workplace (“Health Centers”), centers of excellence for specialty care, and high-performance network (HPN) based health benefit plans, in partnership with health plans. Our team markets &amp; sells these products directly to the purchaser – i.e., consumers, large employers, labor unions. We are looking for people to join our team who are passionate about solving these problems by developing a true system of care that can deliver market-leading value.</p>

   <p>Our research team, based at Queens College-CUNY, seeks a data scientist to collaborate with a multi-disciplinary research team studying influence operations and the role of narrative in radicalization. Under direction from and in close collaboration with a social scientist PI, the data scientist will work on a variety of projects and data sources supporting the team’s ambitious computational social science research agenda related to our DoD-funded research. This is a full-time position. Remote work is possible.</p> 
   <p> We seek a candidate interested in conducting basic and applied research and development with the objective of providing new capabilities to: develop interdisciplinary methods to detect narratives in traditional media sources and in social media; to study networks of narrative content, influencers, and communities; to understand the link between keywords or key images, communities, and narratives and to help codify the ways the same content can mean different things to different parties; to help conduct experiments and survey-based data analysis related to interaction with specific types of content and susceptibility to radicalization; to develop useful measures of effectiveness of online influence campaigns beyond likes and shares; and to develop insights into mitigating the spread of hate and violence.</p> 
   <p> The successful candidate will be expected to take a leading role in developing, testing, and implementing narrative detection models related to both legacy media and social media. Current machine learning techniques often miss cultural nuance, dog whistles, and other important markers of cultural meaning. The successful candidate will develop models and techniques to scale historical archival research to big data platforms. Within the context of the influence operations, how do we predict what narratives will emerge and be weaponized? Critically, how do we use these models to understand domestic vulnerabilities to foreign influence operations? And, how do we maximally reduce the impact of foreign influence operations on and within our organizations? A key piece of this research will use computational social science techniques such as natural language processing and others to model what narratives are being deployed and weaponized but also how those key narratives have developed and changed change and which narratives seem most directly to influence a variety of online and offline behaviors.</p>
